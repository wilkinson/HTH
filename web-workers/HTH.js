//  This file contains the definition for the global "HTH" function I promised
//  in the other files. The convention I am setting here, for tonight's demo as
//  well as future ones, is that all extensions to native functionality will be
//  defined on the HTH function object as methods and/or properties. I also
//  plan to define a better HTH at some point that will return documentation
//  about its contents for interactive exploratory use from a command line :-)

function HTH() {
    "use strict";
    return "Thanks for calling my bluff!";
}
